📊 Business Impact Forecasting, Retention Analysis & KPI Tracking

🚀 Overview

This project explores business impact forecasting by tracking customer retention, spending behavior, and marketing effectiveness. The objective is to understand how companies measure real-time product success, predict future trends, and optimize customer engagement strategies.

## 📂 Dataset 
- **File:** "/kaggle/input/customer-segmentation-clustering/customer_segmentation.csv"
- **Contains:** 1 year of simulated data tracking:
   - 📈 **Adoption Rate**: How many users engage with a product?
   - 💰 **Revenue Growth**: How much financial impact does customer behavior generate?
   - 🔄 **Retention Rate**: How many users continue using the product over time?
   - ❌ **Churn Rate**: How many customers are at risk of leaving?
  
🔍 Data Analysis & Key Findings
  ✅ Customer Retention & Spending Analysis
   - Most customers fall into the Engaged (31-90 days) and Active (0-30 days) categories.
   - Low long-term retention with very few users in the "Cold (181-365 days)" or "At Risk (>365 days)" segments.
   - Wine & Meat Products dominate customer spending across all retention categories.
   - Customers in the Warm (91-180 days) category spend slightly more on meat products than others.
